I decided to go structless and directly access all the packet information
using offsets. I added a translation function to help with port names.
I considered breaking up tcp function but no function is over 50 lines
and I ran out of time. As requested masks instead of byte shifts are used.
I couldn't figure out a good way to mask off half the byte and have it retain
its initial value for the data offset field in the tcp header, so I
reluctantly divided by 16.
