Has 1 known error with list (%L) where it will return everything but the last
character of the handle in all handle list elements, I've tested everything
around packing up and pulliing from the buffers right before and right after
sendPDU and recvPDU around where flags 12 (client) and 10 (server) are handled
for the life of me I don't know why just the last character is not copied over
