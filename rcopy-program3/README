Design Overview

This program implements a Selective Reject ARQ file transfer system over UDP, featuring a sliding window protocol for the sender (server) and an out-of-order buffer for the receiver (rcopy). The design adheres to the Selective Reject ARQ protocol: rcopy sends RR (Receiver Ready) or SREJ (Selective Reject) packets, and the server resends only the specific packets requested.

Design Choices

Server (Sender) - Sliding Window

Window Management: The server maintains a circular buffer (paneBuff) representing the window, with each pane holding packet data, sequence number, and ACK status.

Packet Sending:

sendData() handles a single packet send at a time (either next seqNum or a specific SREJ'd packet).

After each send, pollAckSrej() (non-blocking poll(0)) checks for incoming RRs or SREJs.

If the window fills, the server enters waitOnAckSrej() (blocking poll(1000)) to wait for feedback.

Timeout Handling: After 1s of no response, timeoutOnAck() resends the lowest unACKed packet, as per the Selective Reject spec. This repeats up to 10 times.

EOF Handling:

Upon reaching EOF, the server sends an EOF packet.

It then enters waitOnEofAck() to wait for an EOF_ACK from rcopy.

During EOF wait, it continues handling late RRs/SREJs.

rcopy (Receiver) - Out-of-Order Buffer

Packet Buffer: rcopy uses a circular buffer (PacketBuffer) to store out-of-order packets, indexed by seqNum % windowSize.

Receiving Logic:

If seqNum == expectedSeqNum, rcopy writes directly to file, increments expectedSeqNum, and flushes contiguous packets from the buffer.

If seqNum > expectedSeqNum, rcopy stores the packet and sends an SREJ for the missing expectedSeqNum.

If seqNum < expectedSeqNum, rcopy ignores the packet (duplicate).

Acknowledgment Strategy:

rcopy sends an ACK_RR for the last in-order packet it received (i.e., expectedSeqNum - 1).

rcopy sends an SREJ for the first missing packet.

Key Design Decisions

Window and Buffer Allocation

Server Window:

Pre-allocated based on windowSize.

Each pane pre-allocates space for the specified amount of packet data to be sent (buffer size).

Packets are overwritten only when ACKed and the window slides.

rcopy Buffer:

Pre-allocated based on windowSize.

Stores raw packet data for out-of-order arrivals.

flushBuffer() writes contiguous packets to file as they become in-order.

Sequence Number Management

Server:

Tracks seqNum "globally" in state machine.

Updates seqNum based on RR (seqNum = RR + 1) or SREJ (seqNum = SREJ).

rcopy:

Tracks expectedSeqNum as the next in-order packet.

Timeout Strategy

Server:

1s timeout (poll) when window is full.

Resends only the lowest unACKed packet then send data takes it from there

because seqNum global is updated.

Max 10 retries.

rcopy:

10s timeout in recvData() (poll). Terminates if no packets received for 10s.
